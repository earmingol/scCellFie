# Metabolic functionalities of mammalian cells from single-cell and spatial transcriptomics

## About scCellFie
Single-cell CellFie is a Python implementation of [CellFie](https://github.com/LewisLabUCSD/CellFie), a tool for studying metabolic tasks 
originally developed in MATLAB by the [Lewis Lab](https://lewislab.ucsd.edu/). This version is designed to be 
compatible with single-cell and spatial data analysis using Scanpy.

## Installation
To install scCellFie, use pip:

`pip install sccellfie`

## Features
- **Single cell and spatial data analysis:** Tailored for analysis of metabolic
tasks using fully single cell resolution and in space.

- **Speed:** This implementation further leverages the original CellFie. It is now memory
efficient and run much faster! A dataset of ~70k single cells can be analyzed in ~30 min.

- **New analyses:** From marker selection of relevant metabolic tasks to integration with
inference of cell-cell communication.

- **User-friendly:** Python-based for easier use and integration into existing workflows.

- **Scanpy compatibility:** Fully integrated with Scanpy, the popular single cell
analysis toolkit.
