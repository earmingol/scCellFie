def find_spatial_neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=10, spatial_key='X_spatial'):
    '''
    Finds the spatial neighbors of each cell in adata.

    Parameters
    ----------
    adata: AnnData object
        Annotated data matrix.

    n_neighbors: int, optional (default: 10)
        The number of neighbors to use for k-nearest neighbors.

    spatial_key: str, optional (default: 'X_spatial')
        The key in adata.obsm where the spatial coordinates are stored.

    Returns
    -------
    None
        The spatial neighbors are added to adata.uns['spatial_neighbors'] and
        the spatial connectivities are added to adata.obsp['spatial_connectivities'].
