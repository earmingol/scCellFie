def get_task_determinant_genes(adata, metabolic_task, task_by_rxn, groupby=None, group=None, min_activity=0.0):
    '''
    Finds the genes that determine the activity of all reactions in a metabolic task. Returns determinant genes
    for each reaction and their activity across specified cell groups. If no groups are specified, the analysis
    is performed across all cells.

    Parameters
    ----------
    adata: AnnData object
        Annotated data matrix.

    metabolic_task: str
        Name of the metabolic task to analyze. Must be one of the tasks in the `task_by_rxn` DataFrame.
        It must also be present in the `adata.metabolic_tasks` attribute.

    task_by_rxn: pandas.DataFrame
        A pandas.DataFrame object where rows are metabolic tasks and columns are
        reactions. Each cell contains ones or zeros, indicating whether a reaction
        is involved in a metabolic task.

    groupby: str, optional (default: None)
        The key in the `adata.obs` DataFrame to group by. This could be any
        categorical annotation of cells (e.g., cell type, cluster).

    group: str or list, optional (default: None)
        The group(s) in the `adata.obs` DataFrame to analyze. If `None`, the analysis is performed
        by treating all single cells as a group. If `groups` is specified, `groupby` must be specified.
        The column referred by `groupby` must contain the groups specified in `group`.

    min_activity: float, optional (default: 0.0)
        Minimum reaction activity level to consider a reaction as active. Only genes that are
        associated with active reactions are considered. If zero, all reactions and therefore
        all genes are considered.

    Returns
    -------
    df: pandas.DataFrame
        A pandas.DataFrame reporting the determinant genes for each reaction in the metabolic task.
        Determinant genes are specified for each cell group in `groupby` (or across all cells if `groupby` is None).
        The DataFrame has the following columns:
            - Group: The cell group.
            - Rxn: The reaction.
            - Det-Gene: The determinant gene for the reaction.
            - RAL: The reaction activity level for the reaction.

    Notes
    -----
    This function assumes that reaction activity levels have been computed using
    sccellfie.reaction_activity.compute_reaction_activity() and are stored in adata.reactions.X.

    Scores are computed as previously indicated in the CellFie paper (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crmeth.2021.100040).
